    "This notebook uses the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for numerical simulation of fluid flow to determine and visualize the vortical flow behind a sphere. Written in python and jax.

This particular example increases the Reynolds number to a domain where the BGK collision method would create an unstable simulation.\n",
