    "# The Lattice Boltzmann Method - 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) Method for numerical simulation of fluid flow, writte in python and jax.\n",
    "\n",
    "jax is used to jit (just-in-time) the code, which speeds it up significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is adjusted from the the code presented by Machine Learning & Simulation (MLS) in 2D:\n",

    "- [Git](https://github.com/Ceyron/machine-learning-and-simulation/blob/main/english/simulation_scripts/lattice_boltzmann_method_python_jax.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to watch that video first, because a lot of explanation of this method, the setup and syntax mentioned in that video and code will be skipped here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjustments here are twofold: the code has been adjusted for 3D, and a little noise is implemented. The noise is applied to the input velocities and will make sure interesting features emerge quicker.\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "Let's get started with importing all the relevant packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3D takes a lot longer, even with jitted code. If you are running this on Google Colab or have a GPU that's jax compatible, don't forget to turn it on!"
